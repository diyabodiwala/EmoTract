# EmoTract

This project demonstrates a real-time sentiment analysis system that analyzes social media data from various platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, using Apache Spark, S3, Redshift, and AWS Comprehend. The system collects social media data, stores it in S3, and then uses Apache Spark to process and analyze the data in real-time. The analyzed data is stored in Redshift for further analysis and visualization. AWS Comprehend is used to perform natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as sentiment analysis and entity recognition.

Deployment
----------

1. Create an AWS account and set up an S3 bucket to store the social media data.
2. Create a Redshift cluster and database to store the analyzed data.
3. Create an AWS Comprehend instance to perform NLP tasks.
4. Install Apache Spark on an EC2 instance or use an EMR cluster.
5. Deploy the code to the Apache Spark instance and configure it to read from S3 and write to Redshift.
6. Use a scheduler like Apache Airflow to schedule the job to run at regular intervals.

This project uses the following libraries and services:

* Apache Spark
* AWS S3
* AWS Redshift
* AWS Comprehend
* Apache Airflow (optional)

Getting Started
---------------

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-time-sentiment-analysis.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure the AWS credentials: `export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=my_access_key` and `export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=my_secret_key`
4. Run the sentiment analysis code: `python sentiment_analysis.py`
5. View the analyzed data in Redshift: `psql -h my-cluster.us-east-1.redshift.amazonaws.com -U myuser -d mydb`

Troubleshooting
---------------

* Check the AWS credentials and ensure they are correct.
* Verify that the S3 bucket and Redshift cluster are properly configured.
* Check the Apache Spark logs for any errors or issues.

Future Development
-----------------

* Integrate with other social media platforms, such as Twitter and Instagram.
* Implement additional NLP tasks, such as entity recognition and topic modeling.
* Use machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of the sentiment analysis.
* Develop a web-based dashboard to visualize the analyzed data.
